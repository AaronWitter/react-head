# Contributing

First, thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰

The local development workflow is fairly straightfowrad:

1. Fork the repo and then git clone your fork locally (be sure to work on a new branch, not on your `master` branch)
1. `npm install` in both the root directory and the `example/` directory to get the example app working
1. In one terminal window, run `npm run build:watch` in the root directory, which will watch and transpile the source code
1. In another terminal window, run `npm start` in the `example/` directory and then you can view the example app running at http://localhost:3000
